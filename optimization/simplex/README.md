What I set out to do was understand linear programming and how it is used in optimization.

I was reading "Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight" by John Foreman
and during the section on "Representing the Problem as a Polytope" when I wanted to apply what I had
learned. So, I went online and searched up optimization problems that could be solved using linear
programming. I found some, and solved them.

The directory contains two files (apart from the README): code.py and problems.pdf.
The PDF file has all of the problems, and my mathematical approach to solve the problems.
The python file has my code implementation of the solutions, using the NumPy library.
